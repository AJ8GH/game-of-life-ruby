##Â The Brief

- The game evolves in turns, commonly known as 'ticks'.
- All changes occur at the same time.
- Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours survives until next tick.
- Any live cell with less than 2 live neighbours dies (underpopulation).
- Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies (overpopulation).
- Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction).
- Write code that is capable of calculating each new generation, given a starter board.
- Although you don't have to build a visualisation tool to be able to see the evolution, it should be easy to extend the program to add on a web or command line UI.
